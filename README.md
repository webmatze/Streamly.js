# Streamly.js

A very small functional reactive programming lib for JavaScript.

Turns your asynchronous callback-hell into declarative code heaven, by switching from imperative to functional. Instead of working with uncounted event callbacks you will work with precise and easy to follow event streams.

Here is all you need to get started:

- [Homepage](http://github.com/webmatze/Streamly.js)
- [JavaScript Source](https://github.com/webmatze/Streamly.js/blob/master/dist/streamlyjs.js)
- [Specs](https://github.com/webmatze/Streamly.js/blob/master/test/streamlyjs.spec.js)

## Examples

Here you can find multiple [examples](https://github.com/webmatze/Streamly.js/tree/master/examples)

## Build

Check out the Streamly.js repository and run `npm install`.

Then build the minified sources by running

	./grunt dist

The resulting JavaScript files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Test

Run all unit tests:

	./grunt test

## Dependencies

Runtime: jQuery (optional for jQuery bindings)
Build/test: node.js, npm, grunt

## Inspiration

This lib is inspired by the great functional reactive library [Bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).
